## Linked List

### Singly Linked List

1. Write a program to demonstrate **Singly Linked List** with below operations.
   - Create Signly Linked List.
   - Add a new element to the list at the beginning, in between, and at the end.
   - Delete an element from a list - delete first, last, and intermediate.
   - Display list element.
   - Search element in a list.
   - Revert list. --> Using recursion

2. Write a program to create a singly linked list that accepts only unique elements.
   
3. Write a program to find a connected loop in singly linked list.

   HINT: use flag to mark element is visited.

   BONUS: Remove connected loop in singliy linked list.


### Doubly Linked List

1. Write a program to demonstrate.
   - Create a Doubly Linked List.
   - Add a new element to the list at the beginning, in between, and at the end.
   - Delete an element from a list - delete first, last, and intermediate.
   - Display list element.
   - Search element in a list.
   - Revert list.
  
2. Check connected loop if any - front or rear pointer.
   - If connected remove it.
  
### Circular Linked List
1. Write a program to create **circular singly linked list** with the below operations.
   - Create an empty circular singly linked list
   - Add a new element to the list at the beginning, in between, and at the end.
   - Delete an element from a list - delete first, last, and intermediate.
   - Display list element.
   - Search element in a list.
   - Revert list.
  
2. Write a program to create **circular doubly linked list** with the below operations.
   - Create an empty circular doubly linked list
   - Add a new element to the list at the beginning, in between, and at the end.
   - Delete an element from a list - delete first, last, and intermediate.
   - Display list element.
   - Search element in a list.
   - Revert list.


### Bonus
1. Write a program to sort a singly linked list.

2. Write a program to sort a doubly linked list.
